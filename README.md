# Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata
 
Copied over from: https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata

It is my attempt at the exercise in Java, thus it's slimmed down version of the original repository.

The idea of the exercise is to do some deliberate practice, and improve skills at designing test cases and refactoring. The idea is not to re-write the code from scratch, but rather to practice taking small steps, running the tests often, and incrementally improving the design.

Use Java Version 11.

Run ```sh start_texttest.sh```
